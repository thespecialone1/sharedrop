## üìã Remaining TODO Items (6 tasks)

These are **optional enhancements** - the app is fully functional without them:

### 1. Real-time Polling ‚è≥
**What:** JavaScript polls for selection count updates every 5 seconds  
**Why:** See other users' selections update in real-time  
**Priority:** Low (nice-to-have)  
**Complexity:** Easy (30 min)

### 2. Session Export Endpoint ‚è≥
**What:** `GET /api/sessions/export/:shareID` - full session JSON  
**Why:** Export entire session for backup  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** Easy (45 min)

### 3. Session Import to CreateShare ‚è≥
**What:** Import previous session when creating new share  
**Why:** Continue from previous gallery  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** Medium (1 hour)

### 4. CSV Import Endpoint ‚è≥
**What:** `POST /api/sessions/import/:shareID` - upload CSV  
**Why:** Restore selections from CSV backup  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** Medium (1 hour)

### 5. Dashboard Active Users ‚è≥
**What:** Show active users list in dashboard  
**Why:** See who's currently reviewing  
**Priority:** Low  
**Complexity:** Easy (30 min)

### 6. Dashboard Import UI ‚è≥
**What:** File upload form for CSV/JSON import  
**Why:** Make import user-friendly  
**Priority:** Low (depends on #4)  
**Complexity:** Easy (45 min)

**Total Estimated Time:** ~4-5 hours for all remaining features

## üöÄ How to Build and Distribute Now

### Step 1: Build
```bash
cd /Users/lahrasab/VS\ Code/file-share-app
npm install  # First time only
npm run build:mac
```

### Step 2: Test
```bash
# Built app is at:
open dist/mac/ShareDrop.app

# DMG installer is at:
open dist/ShareDrop.dmg
```

### Step 3: Distribute
Upload `dist/ShareDrop.dmg` to:
- Google Drive / Dropbox
- GitHub Releases
- Your own website
- Direct file transfer

Users just download and install - no other setup needed!

## üìä What's Included in Distribution

### Bundled Automatically:
‚úÖ Go server binary (15MB)  
‚úÖ SQLite support  
‚úÖ Electron UI  
‚úÖ All dependencies  

### User Must Install (Optional):
‚ùå Cloudflared (for internet access)  
‚ùå ImageMagick (for RAW on Windows/Linux)  

**On macOS:** RAW photos work out of the box (using `sips`)

**Passwords:**
- 12-character random strings
- Base64URL encoded
- Stored in database (local file)
- Not encrypted at rest (file system security)

**Files:**
- Never uploaded anywhere
- Streamed directly from your disk
- Path traversal protection
- Password required for access

**Network:**
- Local: Plain HTTP (trusted network)
- Tunnel: HTTPS via Cloudflare

---

## üé® Customization Options

### Branding
Edit `package.json`:
```json
"productName": "YourAppName",
"appId": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
```

### Icons
Replace:
- `icon.icns` (Mac)
- `icon.png` (Windows/Linux)

### Tags
Edit `browseTemplate` in `main.go` to customize tag names/colors

### Port
Change `8080` in `main.go` and `electron-main.js`

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No share expiration enforcement** (ExpiresAt exists but not auto-deleted)
2. **No rate limiting** on downloads
3. **No admin panel** (use dashboard)
4. **Single server instance** (one port only)
5. **No HTTPS** without cloudflared
6. **No password reset** (can manually edit DB)

None of these are blockers for the intended use case!
