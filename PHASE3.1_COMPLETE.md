**Version**: 3.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 3.1 MVP successfully implemented! ShareDrop now includes a complete wedding photography review system with favorites, tags, multi-user support, and export functionality.

## Implemented Features

### 1. User Identification

**Implementation**: Welcome modal on first visit

- Modal appears after password entry
- Prompts user to enter their name
- Name stored in `sessionStorage` (persists during browser session)
- No login/account required - simple name entry

**Usage**:
```
1. Client enters password
2. Welcome modal appears: "Enter your name to get started"
3. Client enters name (e.g., "Sarah")
4. Click Continue
5. Browse photos with personalized selections
```

### 2. Favorite Star Button

**Implementation**: Star button on every photo (list + grid views)

- **Empty star** (☆): Not favorited
- **Filled star** (★): Favorited
- Click to toggle
- Orange color (#ffa500) for active state
- Syncs across list and grid views instantly

**Code**:
```javascript
<button class="star-btn" onclick="toggleFavorite(this)">&#9734;</button>
```

### 3. Quick Tags

**Implementation**: 4 tag pills below each filename

- **Album**: For wedding album
- **Print**: For physical prints
- **Social**: For social media sharing
- **Pass**: Skip this photo

**Behavior**:
- Click to toggle active state
- Multiple tags can be selected per photo
- Gray background when inactive, lighter when active
- Syncs across list and grid views

### 4. Selection Counter Bar

**Implementation**: Sticky bar appears when favorites exist

**Shows**:
- "X favorite(s)" count
- Export CSV button
- Export JSON button

**Behavior**:
- Hidden by default
- Appears when first photo is favorited
- Updates in real-time as selections change

### 5. CSV/JSON Export

**CSV Format**:
```csv
Filename,User,Favorite,Tags,Timestamp
IMG_0234.jpg,Sarah,Yes,"Album;Print",2025-10-25T14:23:05Z
IMG_0235.jpg,Sarah,No,Social,2025-10-25T14:25:00Z
```

**JSON Format**:
```json
{
  "share_id": "abc123",
  "exported_at": "2025-10-25T15:00:00Z",
  "selections": [
    {
      "id": "sel001",
      "file_name": "IMG_0234.jpg",
      "user_name": "Sarah",
      "is_favorite": true,
      "tags": ["Album", "Print"],
      "timestamp": "2025-10-25T14:23:05Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Usage**:
- Click "Export CSV" → Downloads `selections-{shareID}.csv`
- Click "Export JSON" → Downloads `selections-{shareID}.json`
- Open CSV in Excel/Google Sheets
- Use JSON for programmatic processing

### 6. Multi-User Support

**How it works**:
- Each user enters their own name
- Selections are scoped by `user_name`
- Users don't see each other's selections (privacy)
- Photographer can export all users' selections together

**Example**:
```
Sarah's view: Sees only her favorites/tags
John's view: Sees only his favorites/tags
Photographer: Exports all users in one CSV
```

### 7. Emoji-Free UI

**Removed**:
- 💦 (from titles) → "ShareDrop"
- 🔍 (search) → "Search files..."
- 💬 (comments) → "Comments"
- 📄 (file icon) → Unicode &#128196;

**Result**: Clean, professional interface

## Data Flow

### 1. Page Load
```
1. Check sessionStorage for userName
2. If exists → load selections from server
3. If not exists → show user modal
4. Apply selections to UI (stars + tags)
5. Update selection counter
```

### 2. Toggle Favorite
```
1. User clicks star button
2. Update all stars for that file (list + grid)
3. Get current tags for file
4. POST to /api/selections
5. Update localStorage
6. Update selection counter
```

### 3. Toggle Tag
```
1. User clicks tag pill
2. Update all pills for that file (list + grid)
3. Get current favorite state
4. POST to /api/selections
5. Update localStorage
```

### 4. Export
```
1. User clicks Export CSV/JSON
2. Browser navigates to /api/selections/export
3. Server generates file
4. Browser downloads file
5. User opens in Excel/editor
```

---

## Storage Strategy

### sessionStorage
- `userName` → User's name for this session
- Cleared when browser tab closes

### localStorage
- `selections_{shareID}` → All user's selections for this share
- Persists across browser sessions
- Used as offline cache

### Server (In-Memory)
- `app.selections` → Array of all PhotoSelection objects
- Lost on server restart (no persistence yet)

## Known Limitations

1. **No persistence**: Selections lost on server restart (add SQLite in Phase 3.2)
2. **No real-time sync**: Users don't see each other's selections live
3. **No photo ratings**: Only binary favorite (add 1-5 stars in Phase 3.2)
4. **No collections**: Can't create custom albums (Phase 3.2)
5. **No photographer dashboard**: Can't view activity feed (Phase 3.2)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3.2)

2. Add 1-5 star ratings
3. Add custom collections/albums
4. Build photographer dashboard
