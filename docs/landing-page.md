## Security

SharedDrop prioritizes your privacy:

- **No cloud storage** — Files stay on your computer until explicitly downloaded.
- **Encrypted tunnel** — All traffic goes through Cloudflare's secure infrastructure.
- **Session-based** — When you close the session, access is immediately revoked.
- **Password rotation** — Generate a new password anytime without restarting.
- **No accounts** — No sign-ups, no tracking, no data collection.
