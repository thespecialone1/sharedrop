## Quick Start

3. A notification shows your internet URL (if cloudflared is installed)
4. Browser opens to http://localhost:8080
5. Create a share by entering a folder path
6. **For internet sharing**: Replace `localhost:8080` in the link with your tunnel URL from the notification
7. Send link + password to your client

## Getting Folder Paths

### Option 1: Copy Path (Easiest)

2. Hold **Option** key  
3. Click "Copy as Pathname"
4. Paste into ShareDrop

### Option 2: Drag to Terminal
1. Open Terminal
2. Type `echo ` (with space)
3. Drag folder to Terminal window
4. Press Enter, copy the path shown

### Option 3: Type Common Paths
Replace `USERNAME` with yours:
```
/Users/USERNAME/Desktop
/Users/USERNAME/Documents
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads
/Users/USERNAME/Pictures
```

## Internet Sharing

To share with people outside your network, install Cloudflare Tunnel:

```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Restart ShareDrop. It will auto-generate public URLs.

## How It Works

1. Select a folder on your Mac
2. ShareDrop creates a unique link + password
3. Share credentials with your client
4. Client browses and downloads files
5. Everything streams directly from your machine

## Development

Built with Go. To run from source:

```bash
go build -o file-share-app main.go
./run-app.sh
```
