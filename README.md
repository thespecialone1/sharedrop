3. Double-click ShareDrop.app
4. **That's it!** No installation, no dependencies needed

### Internet Sharing (Optional)
To share files with anyone on the internet:

```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Restart ShareDrop - it will automatically create public URLs.

**Note**: Internet sharing is optional. ShareDrop works perfectly on your local network without any additional setup.

## Getting Folder Paths

### Option 1: Copy Path (Easiest)
1. Right-click folder in Finder
2. Hold **Option** key  
3. Click "Copy as Pathname"
4. Paste into ShareDrop

### Option 2: Drag to Terminal
1. Open Terminal
2. Type `echo ` (with space)
3. Drag folder to Terminal window
4. Press Enter, copy the path shown

### Option 3: Type Common Paths
Replace `USERNAME` with yours:
```
/Users/USERNAME/Desktop
/Users/USERNAME/Documents
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads
/Users/USERNAME/Pictures
```

## Internet Sharing

To share with people outside your network, install Cloudflare Tunnel:

```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Restart ShareDrop. It will auto-generate public URLs.

## How It Works

1. Select a folder on your Mac
2. ShareDrop creates a unique link + password
3. Share credentials with your client
4. Client browses and downloads files
5. Everything streams directly from your machine

## Development

Built with Go. To run from source:

```bash
go build -o file-share-app main.go
./run-app.sh
```

## Tech Stack
